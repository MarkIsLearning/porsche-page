    <h3>There have been many sub-models:</h3>
    <ul>
    <li>911</li>
    <li>SC</li>
    <li>Carrera</li>
    <li>993</li>
    <li>996</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>The early years (1963-1973)</h3>
    <p>
    The 901 concept of 1963 heralded the start of a production run even Porsche probably didn’t expect to reach – and no doubt surpass – six decades. Trivia fans can rejoice at the fact the name changed form 901 to 911 to avoid potential fisticuffs with Peugeot.
    It was designed as a larger, more practical version of the 356 with an extra pair of seats. As such, critics were quick to pounce on its lack of focus.
    Early 911s used two-litre engines with as little as 130bhp, though they also weighed bang on a tonne. Both engine sizes and power outputs swelled over the next decade, culminating in perhaps the most coveted of all early 911s, the 210bhp 2.7 Carrera RS.

    <h3>The 964 (1989-1994)</h3>
    <p>The 964, to give it its internal codename, arrived at the very end of the 1980s, bringing with it some mildly updated styling but a whole heap of new tech.
    In fact, it was 85 per cent new. Four-wheel drive arrived for the first time, as did other tech goodies like power steering, ABS brakes and airbags.
    </p>

    <h3>The 993 (1994-1998)</h3>
    <p>We’re going to stick with Porsche’s internal model codes, both to avoid confusion and because they’re reasonably well known among car nerds. The 993 arrived just five years after the 964, and is still regarded by many Porsche die-hards as the prettiest and best-judged of the lot.
    </p>

    <h3>The 996 (1998-2001)</h3>
    <p>Following such a loved generation of car, the 1998 arrival of the water-cooled 996 was met with grumbles and cries of ‘it’s lost its character.
